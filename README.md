# Python-Message-Encryptor
Ceaser Cipher/Vigenère Cipher/Morse Code Convertor

This is a basic python counsol based program to Encrypt or Decrypt a message using Ceaser Cipher, Vigenère Cipher and Morse Code.
To Run this program no additional setup is required. Just download the .py file and make sure you have a python idle or compilier installed.

This was one of my earlier codes, and was written entirely using if-elif ladder.

Will add GUI using Python Tkinter and rewrite the program using Classes and Functions soon.

Thank you.
